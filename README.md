# Memory Bank

 A memory game built in React

---

Welcome to Memory Bank! The objective of the game is simple: click on all of the icon buttons 
without clicking on the same one twice. Every time you click on a new icon, your score will go 
up by one. If you click on the same icon twice, you lose!

Press the `Restart` button at any time to restart.

Good Luck!
